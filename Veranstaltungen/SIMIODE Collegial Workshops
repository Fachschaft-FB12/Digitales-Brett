Day 1 - Wednesday, 7 July 2021, 1:30 – 4:00 PM Eastern US Time

Assignment materials with initial invitation sent out to participants one week before Day 1: Collect data with sheet for death and immigration, so-called m&m modeling scenario, come prepared to do modeling and parameter estimation

    (1:30 – 2:00 PM)

Modeling first -  m&m modeling. GO over as class m&m model with their data.

    (2:00 – 2:30 PM)

Introduction to SIMIODE and its features, with emphasis on teaching support

    (2:30 – 3:00 PM)

Ant Tunnel Model on the spot, appropriate for Calculus II – especially get to rejecting proposed models as a good lesson on reality check for your own model you put forth

    (3:00 – 3:30 PM)

Kinetics models – data provided from chemistry course texts

    (3:30 – 4:00 PM)

Sublimation of carbon dioxide – data previously collected in a classroom

Assignment for next time: Collect data on YouTube videos of Falling Column of Water found at SIMIODE's YouTube Channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC14lC-tyBGkDPmUnKMV3f3w (Data Collection for Modeling Scenarios). Take various columns of water with 5/64, 7/64, 9/64, 11/64, and 13/64”  small bore hole and identical cross-sectional areas. Take first letter of your last name A = 1, B = 2, . . . . .   Z = 26, and mod 5 it so 0 does 5/64, 1 does 7/64, . . . , 4 does 13/64. Collect about 12 data points of height and time. Zero out your clock by subtracting actual time of first observation to report t = 0 height through 12th time shifted height. Enter in provided/emailed EXCEL sheet. We will also provide second “answer” sheet with generic data as well for your use.

QuickView and Reflection: What new or reinforces of ideas do you have as a result of this session? What action might you take? Post them in Group Forum for all to read and react to.
Day 2 – Tuesday, 13 July 2021, 1:30 – 4:00 PM Eastern US Time

Assignment:  Select five Modeling Scenarios from Starter Kit and ask them to plan a lesson and come prepared to share (or listen!) about how they would proceed. (30-minute session and discussion with capture in chat for ideas). Use breakout with three to a group 10 minutes each.

    (1:30 – 2:00 PM)

Discuss SIMIODE’s new digital text, Differential Equations: A Toolbox for Modeling the World, its  methods, rich material and exercises, style, presentation, goals, and how it might be used in course.

    (2:00 – 2:30 PM)

Bullet resistance – a shot in the water

    (2:30 – 3:00 PM)

Modeling falling  column of water with participant data

    (3:00 – 3:30 PM)

Tuned Mass Dampers - using Free Body Diagram to build the system of differential equations used to dampen swaying in large structures and then run with various tuned and untuned frequencies.

    OR

Oil Slick for frustration and data fitting – using incorrectly collected data

                     (3:30 – 4:00 PM)

How deep is well,  hang time, coffee filter or shuttlecock, Ferris wheel toss – get to essence of issues involving projective motion or falling object

QuickView and Reflection: What new or reinforces of ideas do you have as a result of this session? What action might you take? Post them in Group Forum for all to read and react.
Day 3 – Monday, 19 July 2021, 1:30 – 4:30 PM Eastern US Time

Assignment: Plan a lesson based on a Modeling Scenario in SIMIODE (see Starter Kit or design your own, but then think about publishing your work in SIMIODE see https://www.simiode.org/about-peer-review .

    (1:30 – 2:00 PM)

Break Outs for Day 2 Assignment: Select two Modeling Scenarios from Starter Kit, plan a lesson, and come prepared to share (or listen!) about how you would proceed. (30-minute session and discussion with capture in chat for ideas). Use breakout with three to a group at 10 minutes each.

    (2:00 – 2:30 PM)

Drug absorption models two-compartment models and/or dialysis machine study

    (2:30 – 3:00 PM)

Examine and consider some more advanced Modeling Scenarios

    Machine Replacement with Laplace Transform and Convolution
    Gause competition modeling
    SIR Boys School data model

    (3:00 – 3:30 PM)

LSD compartment model – in depth – data fitting, to show how you can get concentrations in tissues, JUST by knowing concentration in blood, and examine correlation of LSD in the brain with arithmetic test scores

    (3:30 – 4:00 PM)

Break outs about how you would proceed to use the material. What do you need to do? Find a place in your course, think logistics, assignment. See Modeling Scenarios at https://www.simiode.org/resources/modelingscenarios which can be modified and personalized. 3 to a group with 10 minutes/person each sharing their proposal/plan.

    (4:00 – 4:30 PM) Wrap-up and Sharing of Ideas

Farewell and ask for completion of Survey in the next few days, please.

QuickView and Reflection: What new or reinforced ideas do you have as a result of this session? What action might you take? Post them in Group Forum for all to read and react to.
